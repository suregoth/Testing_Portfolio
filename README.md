## About me
For a couple of years I have been mainly specialising in photography but now I would like to gain experience in software testing. At university my favourite subjects were: data analysis and HTML&CSS. I also attended many Geek Girls Carrots meetings. In 2021, I renewed my databases and programming interests and after a year I gained the Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer certification. 
I also gained interest in software testing. At my current job Iâ€˜m responsible for quality assurance and I like to do it with high attention to detail, therefore I think I would make a good tester. I am currently studying with Udemy courses, blogs, CTFL Syllabus and other online resources.
